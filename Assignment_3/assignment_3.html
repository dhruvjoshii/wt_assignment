		<font size="6">I</font> am Dhruv Joshi. I’ve completed my school in United Arab Emirates, and now I am pursuing my bachelor’s degree in charotar university of science and technology in India.
		<br>
		I was born in Porbandar,Gujarat Which is also the birthplace of the great Mahatma Gandhi. I've spent most of my childhood over there and then along with my family migrated to UAE where i completed the rest of my education. I have returned to India to complete my studies and i'm planning to goto Canada for my master's.
		<br>
		I am certain that my degree will become my ticket to a better tomorrow. I want to become a renowned lawyer in the field of employment legislation. I study hard and devote my free time to reading scholarly reviews and watching interviews with recognized specialists in the field.
		<br>
		I have come to believe that two main factors determine success. First of all is a person’s own determination and will to succeed. Are you ready to make sacrifices to achieve your goal, like working and studying at the same time? Are you prepared to recover after failure and proceed to your goal again? Without strong internal motivation, it is nearly impossible to become successful.
